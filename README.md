# GS2d_Triton
Gaussian Splaiting 2d implemented in triton

Cause I am not very familiar with **GPU Arch**, so the inference performance is suboptimal.

but the memory reduction is substansial! so i am very happy to share this repo to public.



Feel free to leave some suggestion to further improve my codebase....
